                <p class="rotate-flavour">Note: All lists are read bottom to top!!!</p>

                <p>
                    A krooked slots module consists of three slots, each with an internal wheel that has six numbers
                    on it. Moreover, with seven buttons that can't never be not unpressed, doing so to every
                    button is the only method to receive an erroneous response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially, the slots will display your Number, pressing the submit button may or may not
                    reveal your Current number. The objective is to use the arrow buttons to
                    rotate the slots such that they collectively display Your solution number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Firstly</strong>, to obtain the numbers on each wheel, use the current serial
                    and the rules below, where the first rule refers to all slots without
                    a prime position.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        First take all unevenly positioned characters and use their values for 
                        the first-third Second numbers, otherwise for the first four First numbers
                        use their alphanumeric position % 10, otherwise add up all the individual numbers in 
                        the binary form of the original number. Second if by putting each battery in 
                        a separate holder the amount increases; by less than 2, shift the string 
                        of types by the number obtained from Appendix R1G#T 5H1FT.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        First from all numbers construct three groups of two single numbers. Second 
                        treat them as hexatrigesimal numbers and take the rightmost and second to last significant
                        numbers from their decanary form. Third note that all numbers that aren't in 
                        a non-prime position are Second numbers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        First treat all of the characters as being in unbinbielevenary, second take their
                        first number in reverse scanline reading order from their denary form. First numbers'
                        absolute difference from both forms will be greater than π. Third to remove an
                        uneven count of the types, first change the second First number 
                        to the non-First type, otherwise first change the first Second number to a First
                        number. Never apply a rule that changes the absolute difference of the types to an
                        even number greater than 0.00000001, unless you have an altered serial number, in which case a rule
                        that would bring you farther away from another slot's relation of their types.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If possible sort the strings such that their first number is the last occurrence of it being
                    indifferent from your Number's number that's in the position that corresponds to
                    the negative value of the difference between lit indicators, unlit indicators and
                    your string's position and if this value is outside the range of -4-4 exclusive
                    then modulo three, treating zero as three.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    <strong>Fourthly</strong>, for all slots if you can fully see the Current number, if it isn't 
                    centered, when submitting you'll be required to not see your Magic number: if your Current arrow
                    is closer to the up button if there are less plates than ports, otherwise if there are less serials
                    (All types) than Parallels, otherwise pass by your Magic number the amount of times gotten from 
                    Appendix M4G1CNUM, your Magic number is equal to your Current number's value and while it isn't 
                    on the wheel one time then incerment it and check again, if done more than 25.76 times, END (V=1s/s),
                    otherwise (V = +WIDGETS s/s ; -SERIALNUMBERS (Alternating)), take the longest path to your goal,
                    unless it is one away from your Current number, in which case take the shortest, otherwise (V= ....... slots/seconds) divide the 
                    upper "Current number's" diffirence of all of it's possibilities* lowered low to high, and 
                    likewise with the other one, round the result to any whole number over four which allows you to see 
                    all of the numbers on the wheel. Note that the middle wheel's buttons' functionalities are inversed,
                    therefore the "V" button will rotate the wheel upwards, in text form going leftward.
                </p>
                <p class="comment">* Every part of 0 and 8 is regarded as similar, as well as the bottom half of 6 and 
                    the top half of 9.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Secondly</strong>, to obtain your first number of your Your solution number, to the integer
                    form of half of the number in your Number with the same index as this slot add
                    the minimum of: the diffirence between double your third Second number, and the
                    sum of your first First and Second numbers; the sum of the absoluten't value
                    of the sum of your third First number and your second Second number, and
                    double your second First number. Divide that with 10 and take the rightmost number.<br>
                    Likewise for the second number, from the product of this slot's number from your Number
                    incremented by the third amount and your second Second number and your 
                    first First number made into one number subtracted from your second First number and your third Second number
                    made into one number plus your third First number and your first Second number
                    made into one number subtract the number of duplicate port 
                    types and take the first number in traditional chinese reading order.<br>
                    Take the least significant number of the result of double the negative
                    value of the originally displayed number added to the sum of 
                    the absolute value of the diffirence of the third and first Second numbers
                    taken away from your second Second number, and the diffirence between the 
                    third First number and the absolute value of the subtraction of your first 
                    and second First numbers.

                    <strong>Thirdly</strong>, a reminder that pressing the opposite of a
                    pressed button will cancel the latter's function. Furthermore pressing the submit
                    button first will spin the slots like mentioned above, unless 
                    there is a NLL indicator on the module xnor the bomb has 3/±2+6n+10/4 widgets nand all of
                    the above rules were logical, in which case it should be pressed last, with the 
                    wheels being at offsets of +4 ; -5+2 ; -191152354 respectively, unless every module
                    doesn't share the same author nor seven wires aren't present, in which case press the 
                    fifth button in geometric reading order when the timer displays 07:53, 00.43,
                    04:73, or 34:08. When pressing the submit button first first make sure that it's done when 
                    the first seconds number is your second First number from your second nor first number from 
                    your Number, or when equivalent, unless you've ever experienced a pacing event, in which case give 
                    this treatment to the next press instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Lastly</strong>, if you haven't submitted an incorrect solution, the module
                    might solve. If the manual thus far hasn't been unoptimized enough, feel free to
                    consult Appendix 53V3R, otherwise for getting a character's value
                    in the following table use the column
                    thats shifted by the avarege value of all voltage meters present if there are 
                    less than 2 mods present on the bomb, otherwise use the bolded number that's in the
                    same row position, othwerise if there are more ports than indicators, use the visually
                    closest underlined number, otherwise the sum of the closet bolded number in the same
                    row and the closest underlined number in the same column, otherwise it's alphanumeric
                    position.

                    by a computer program on a television screen or other display screen
                    called "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes," which is a game played 
                    by multiple people, either in-person or remotely. One person "defuses"
                    the explosive, while they cannot see the manual to defuse the 
                    explosive. The "experts" which are the other playershave the 
                    manual to defuse the explosive, but cannot see the explosive. 
                    To defuse the explosive, the experts and the defuser must
                    communicate to each other what to do to defuse the explosive. 
                    The game may be played on a variety of devices, such desktop
                    platforms such Windows, macOS, and Linux, mobile operating 
                    systems such Android and iOS, consoles such as the Xbox One S,

                    coating of the metal and the location of the metal on the 
                    framework presented. If an erroneous sever is made on a metal
